Some time ago I stumbled upon [KaiOS](https://www.kaiostech.com/) a fork of FirefoxOS that actually had users. Millions of users. Mostly thanks to the [JioPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jio#JioPhone) that is \"sold\" in India for nothing. Litterally nothing, except for a deposit of ₹1500 (~€20).

<p>A stupid phone, as in not a &quot;smart&quot; phone. Just a phone or &quot;feature phone&quot;, as it is called. Having fond memories of old Nokia phones, I did not hesitate, I bought one immediatly.

<h3>Time to start hacking</h3>
<p>I am not a huge mobile phone user, so my need for apps is pretty low. I used my previous phone for three things: browsing, recording my bike rides and look up public transport timetables. The phone already has a browser. The experience is pretty bad, the screen is tiny and you move the mouse with the arrow keys. It could work for emergencies but for reading while on the move, I will have to carry a book. Maybe that is a good thing. So I just need two apps: one to look up timetables and another to record my bike rides.</p>
<p>I already had an app to record GPS positions for FirefoxOS and just needed to adapt it. The documentation for <a href="https://developer.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS developers</a> is rather underwhelming. It mostly consists of a &quot;design guide&quot; and links to Mozilla's &quot;archive of obsolete content&quot;. The &quot;simulator&quot; is buggy but kind of works. The difference compared to FirefoxOS is that you have to use key navigation. And the screen is tiny. It does not leave much room for creative design and I find that rather liberating. You just need to focus on getting the job done.</p>
